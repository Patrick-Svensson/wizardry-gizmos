        <h2>An introduction to Harry Potter</h2>
        <p>
            Harry Potter is a series of seven fantasy novels written by British author J. K. Rowling. 
            The novels chronicle the lives of a young wizard, Harry Potter, and his friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, 
            all of whom are students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. 
            The main story arc concerns Harry's struggle against Lord Voldemort, a dark wizard who intends to become immortal, 
            overthrow the wizard governing body known as the Ministry of Magic and subjugate all wizards and Muggles (non-magical people).

                A Revealer is a bright red eraser, used to make invisible ink appear. 
                It made its first appearance in Chamber of Secrets when Hermione tried to 
                make hidden writing appear in Tom Riddle's diary.

                The Secrecy Sensor is a dark detector described as "an object that looked something like an extra-squiggly, 
                golden television aerial." It vibrates when it detects concealment and lies. 
                In Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Moody mentions that it is "no use here, of course, 
                too much interference – students in every direction lying about why they haven’t done their homework." 
                However, it may have been responding to Moody's own deception, 
                as he was actually Barty Crouch Jr in disguise with a Polyjuice Potion.

                A Sneakoscope serves as a Dark Arts detector. The device is described as a miniature glass spinning-top 
                that emits shrill noises in the presence of deception, for instance, 
                when an untrustworthy person is near or when a deceitful event takes place nearby.
