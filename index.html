                <h2>An introduction to Harry Potter</h2>
            </header>
            <p>
                Harry Potter is a series of seven fantasy novels written by British author J. K. Rowling. 
                The novels chronicle the lives of a young wizard, Harry Potter, and his friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, 
                all of whom are students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. 
                The main story arc concerns Harry's struggle against Lord Voldemort, a dark wizard who intends to become immortal, 
                overthrow the wizard governing body known as the Ministry of Magic and subjugate all wizards and Muggles (non-magical people).

                Since the release of the first novel, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, on 26 June 1997, 
                the books have found immense popularity, positive reviews, and commercial success worldwide. 
                They have attracted a wide adult audience as well as younger readers and are often considered 
                cornerstones of modern young adult literature.[2] As of February 2018, 
                the books have sold more than 500 million copies worldwide, making them the best-selling book series in history, 
                and have been translated into eighty languages.[3] The last four books consecutively set records 
                as the fastest-selling books in history, with the final installment selling roughly eleven million copies 
                in the United States within twenty-four hours of its release.

                <h2>Detectors</h2>
            </header>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>The Revealer</h3>
                    <p>
                        A Revealer is a bright red eraser, used to make invisible ink appear. 
                        It made its first appearance in Chamber of Secrets when Hermione tried to 
                        make hidden writing appear in Tom Riddle's diary.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <h3>The Secrecy Sensor</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Secrecy Sensor is a dark detector described as "an object that looked something like an extra-squiggly, 
                        golden television aerial." It vibrates when it detects concealment and lies. 
                        In Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Moody mentions that it is "no use here, of course, 
                        too much interference – students in every direction lying about why they haven’t done their homework." 
                        However, it may have been responding to Moody's own deception, 
                        as he was actually Barty Crouch Jr in disguise with a Polyjuice Potion.

                    <h3>The Sneakoscope</h3>
                    <p>
                        A Sneakoscope serves as a Dark Arts detector. The device is described as a miniature glass spinning-top 
                        that emits shrill noises in the presence of deception, for instance, 
                        when an untrustworthy person is near or when a deceitful event takes place nearby.

            </header>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>The Deluminator</h3>
                    <p>
                        A Deluminator is a device invented by Albus Dumbledore that resembles a cigarette lighter. 
                        It is used to remove or absorb (as well as return) the light from any light source to provide cover to the user. 
                        In Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Dumbledore uses the Deluminator (then referred to as the Put-Outer)
                        [HP1] to darken Privet Drive, where the Dursley family's house is located. 
                        It was next seen in Order of the Phoenix where Dumbledore loans the Deluminator to Moody, 
                        who uses it when transporting Harry from the Dursleys' home to Number 12, Grimmauld Place (Sirius's home). 
                        In Half-Blood Prince, Dumbledore uses the Deluminator again to darken Privet Drive before collecting Harry.
                    </p>

                <br>
                <li>
                    <h3>The Invisibility Cloak</h3>
                    <p>
                        Harry's cloak which he inherited from his father James Potter, is one of the three Deathly Hallows, 
                        making it a true cloak of invisibility, and it will retain its invisibility forever. 
                        It is also resistant to most simple spells and charms (e.g. the summoning charm).
                        [1] Invisibility cloaks protect the wearer from visual detection only, meaning that even though the wearer 
                        cannot be seen they are still solid, and can therefore be felt by physical contact. 
                        Alastor Moody's magically charmed eye is able to penetrate them. The cloak is less effective against some animals, 
                        such as cats (e.g. Mrs. Norris) and snakes (e.g. Nagini). The Dementors in the books have no sense of sight 
                        and instead sense human despair, a sense unhindered by the use of an invisibility cloak.
