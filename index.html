                    <p>
                        Harry Potter is a series of seven fantasy novels written by British author J. K. Rowling. 
                        The novels chronicle the lives of a young wizard, Harry Potter, and his friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, 
                        all of whom are students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. 
                        The main story arc concerns Harry's struggle against Lord Voldemort, a dark wizard who intends to become immortal, 
                        overthrow the wizard governing body known as the Ministry of Magic and subjugate all wizards and Muggles (non-magical people).
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                        The central character in the series is Harry Potter, a boy who lives in the fictional town of Little Whinging, 
                        Surrey with his aunt, uncle, and cousin – the Dursleys – and discovers at the age of eleven that he is a wizard, 
                        though he lives in the ordinary world of non-magical people known as Muggles.[8] 
                        The wizarding world exists parallel to the Muggle world, albeit hidden and in secrecy. 
                        His magical ability is inborn, and children with such abilities are invited to attend exclusive magic schools 
                        that teach the necessary skills to succeed in the wizarding world.[9]

                            <h3>The Revealer</h3>
                            <p>
                                A Revealer is a bright red eraser, used to make invisible ink appear. 
                                It made its first appearance in Chamber of Secrets when Hermione tried to 
                                make hidden writing appear in Tom Riddle's diary.
                            </p><br>
                        </li>               
                        <li>
                            <h3>The Secrecy Sensor</h3>
                            <p>
                                The Secrecy Sensor is a dark detector described as "an object that looked something like an extra-squiggly, 
                                golden television aerial." It vibrates when it detects concealment and lies. 
                                In Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Moody mentions that it is "no use here, of course, 
                                too much interference – students in every direction lying about why they haven’t done their homework." 
                                However, it may have been responding to Moody's own deception, 
                                as he was actually Barty Crouch Jr in disguise with a Polyjuice Potion.

                            <p>
                                A Sneakoscope serves as a Dark Arts detector. The device is described as a miniature glass spinning-top 
                                that emits shrill noises in the presence of deception, for instance, 
                                when an untrustworthy person is near or when a deceitful event takes place nearby.

                        <li>
                            <h3>The Deluminator</h3>
                            <p>
                                A Deluminator is a device invented by Albus Dumbledore that resembles a cigarette lighter. 
                                It is used to remove or absorb (as well as return) the light from any light source to provide cover to the user. 
                                In Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Dumbledore uses the Deluminator (then referred to as the Put-Outer)
                                [HP1] to darken Privet Drive, where the Dursley family's house is located. 
                                It was next seen in Order of the Phoenix where Dumbledore loans the Deluminator to Moody, 
                                who uses it when transporting Harry from the Dursleys' home to Number 12, Grimmauld Place (Sirius's home). 
                                In Half-Blood Prince, Dumbledore uses the Deluminator again to darken Privet Drive before collecting Harry.
                            </p><br>
                        </li>                
                        <li>
                            <h3>The Invisibility Cloak</h3>
                            <p>
                                Harry's cloak which he inherited from his father James Potter, is one of the three Deathly Hallows, 
                                making it a true cloak of invisibility, and it will retain its invisibility forever. 
                                It is also resistant to most simple spells and charms (e.g. the summoning charm).
                                [1] Invisibility cloaks protect the wearer from visual detection only, meaning that even though the wearer 
                                cannot be seen they are still solid, and can therefore be felt by physical contact. 
                                Alastor Moody's magically charmed eye is able to penetrate them. The cloak is less effective against some animals, 
                                such as cats (e.g. Mrs. Norris) and snakes (e.g. Nagini). The Dementors in the books have no sense of sight 
                                and instead sense human despair, a sense unhindered by the use of an invisibility cloak.

                            <h3>Arthur Weasley's flying Ford Anglia</h3>
                            <p>
                                Arthur Weasley owned a 1960 Ford Anglia 105E that he subsequently enchanted; consequently, 
                                the vehicle can fly, become invisible, and carry the entire Weasley family in spite of its 
                                formerly non-enchanted interior dimensions (also the Undetectable Extension Charm), among other abilities. 
                                In Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, the car is borrowed by Fred, George and Ron, 
                                who use it to rescue Harry from the Dursleys' house. Ron and Harry later steal the car in order to 
                                return to Hogwarts after the gate to Platform 9¾ is sealed by Dobby. After they arrive at school, 
                                landing in the Whomping Willow, the car ejects Harry, Ron, and their luggage, 
                                then flees into the Forbidden Forest, ignoring Ron's pleas for it to come back. 
                                Mr Weasley soon faces an inquiry at the Ministry of Magic, as seven Muggles saw the car flying 
                                across the countryside, and is forced to pay a large fine.

                            <h3>Broomsticks</h3>
                            <p>
                                Broomsticks are used for transportation by witches and wizards of all ages, 
                                and for participating in the game of Quidditch. Their use is similar to that of flying carpets, 
                                although the latter are banned in Great Britain by the Ministry of Magic. However, 
                                they are uncomfortable for extended trips, even with a cushion charm applied, 
                                and thus many wizards favour other means of transport for those journeys.

                            <p>
                                Floo Powder is a glittering powder used by wizards to travel and communicate using fireplaces. 
                                It was invented by Ignatia Wildsmith (1227–1320) and named after the flue, 
                                which is the passageway that leads from a fireplace to the chimney and allows hot gases to escape.

                            The Deathly Hallows are three magical objects that are the focus of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows
                            – the Elder Wand, the Resurrection Stone, and a cloak of invisibility. When owned by one person, 
                            they are said to give mastery over death. The objects are generally remembered only as part of a wizard's 
                            fairy tale called The Tale of the Three Brothers, and have become mythological over time, 
                            but a small number of wizards including Dumbledore still believe in their existence and seek them.

                            <p>
                                The Elder Wand, known throughout history as the Deathstick or the Wand of Destiny, 
                                is an extremely powerful wand made of elder wood with a core of Thestral tail hair. 
                                While most wizards have heard of supposedly invincible wands in wizarding history, 
                                wand experts and seekers after the Deathly Hallows realize that these are the same wand, 
                                reappearing periodically in the hand of a new owner.

                            <h3>Resurrection Stone</h3>
                            <p>
                                The Resurrection Stone allows the holder to bring back deceased loved ones, in a semi-physical form, 
                                and communicate with them. According to the fairy tale concerning the origin of the Deathly Hallows, 
                                using the Resurrection Stone drove the owner to kill himself because he brought his late fiancée back from the dead, 
                                and she was very unhappy in the real world for she did not belong there. 
                                By the time the stone was seen in Marvolo Gaunt's possession, it had been set into a ring that bore the symbol 
                                of the Deathly Hallows, which the ignorant Gaunt believed to be the Peverell coat of arms; he used the ring to 
                                boast about his ancestry and blood purity. Both Dumbledore and Grindelwald desired the stone, but for different reasons. While Dumbledore wanted it to communicate with his dead family, Grindelwald allegedly intended to use it to create an army of zombie-like Inferi.

                            <h3>Cloak of Invisibility</h3>
                            <p>
                                According to the legend, the Cloak of Invisibility has the power to shield the wearer from being seen by Death. 
                                It was the Hallow belonging to the youngest brother, who did not trust Death and took the cloak to hide from him, 
                                only giving it up when he was old and ready for death. It is owned by Harry throughout the series, 
                                although only later does he discover its significance and origin.
