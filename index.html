                <h2>An introduction to Harry Potter</h2>
            </header>
            <p>
                Harry Potter is a series of seven fantasy novels written by British author J. K. Rowling. 
                The novels chronicle the lives of a young wizard, Harry Potter, and his friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, 
                all of whom are students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. 
                The main story arc concerns Harry's struggle against Lord Voldemort, a dark wizard who intends to become immortal, 
                overthrow the wizard governing body known as the Ministry of Magic and subjugate all wizards and Muggles (non-magical people).
            </p><br>
            <p>
                The central character in the series is Harry Potter, a boy who lives in the fictional town of Little Whinging, 
                Surrey with his aunt, uncle, and cousin – the Dursleys – and discovers at the age of eleven that he is a wizard, 
                though he lives in the ordinary world of non-magical people known as Muggles.[8] 
                The wizarding world exists parallel to the Muggle world, albeit hidden and in secrecy. 
                His magical ability is inborn, and children with such abilities are invited to attend exclusive magic schools 
                that teach the necessary skills to succeed in the wizarding world.[9]

                <h2>Detectors</h2>
            </header>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>The Revealer</h3>
                    <p>
                        A Revealer is a bright red eraser, used to make invisible ink appear. 
                        It made its first appearance in Chamber of Secrets when Hermione tried to 
                        make hidden writing appear in Tom Riddle's diary.
                    </p><br>
                </li>               
                <li>
                    <h3>The Secrecy Sensor</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Secrecy Sensor is a dark detector described as "an object that looked something like an extra-squiggly, 
                        golden television aerial." It vibrates when it detects concealment and lies. 
                        In Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Moody mentions that it is "no use here, of course, 
                        too much interference – students in every direction lying about why they haven’t done their homework." 
                        However, it may have been responding to Moody's own deception, 
                        as he was actually Barty Crouch Jr in disguise with a Polyjuice Potion.

                    <h3>The Sneakoscope</h3>
                    <p>
                        A Sneakoscope serves as a Dark Arts detector. The device is described as a miniature glass spinning-top 
                        that emits shrill noises in the presence of deception, for instance, 
                        when an untrustworthy person is near or when a deceitful event takes place nearby.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>The Deluminator</h3>
                    <p>
                        A Deluminator is a device invented by Albus Dumbledore that resembles a cigarette lighter. 
                        It is used to remove or absorb (as well as return) the light from any light source to provide cover to the user. 
                        In Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Dumbledore uses the Deluminator (then referred to as the Put-Outer)
                        [HP1] to darken Privet Drive, where the Dursley family's house is located. 
                        It was next seen in Order of the Phoenix where Dumbledore loans the Deluminator to Moody, 
                        who uses it when transporting Harry from the Dursleys' home to Number 12, Grimmauld Place (Sirius's home). 
                        In Half-Blood Prince, Dumbledore uses the Deluminator again to darken Privet Drive before collecting Harry.
                    </p><br>
                </li>                
                <li>
                    <h3>The Invisibility Cloak</h3>
                    <p>
                        Harry's cloak which he inherited from his father James Potter, is one of the three Deathly Hallows, 
                        making it a true cloak of invisibility, and it will retain its invisibility forever. 
                        It is also resistant to most simple spells and charms (e.g. the summoning charm).
                        [1] Invisibility cloaks protect the wearer from visual detection only, meaning that even though the wearer 
                        cannot be seen they are still solid, and can therefore be felt by physical contact. 
                        Alastor Moody's magically charmed eye is able to penetrate them. The cloak is less effective against some animals, 
                        such as cats (e.g. Mrs. Norris) and snakes (e.g. Nagini). The Dementors in the books have no sense of sight 
                        and instead sense human despair, a sense unhindered by the use of an invisibility cloak.
